# Vantura Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the Vantura SDK in various scenarios.

## 🚀 Basic Example (`example.dart`)

The [example.dart](example.dart) file shows the fundamental setup:
1. Initializing the `VanturaClient`.
2. Setting up `VanturaMemory` and `VanturaState`.
3. Creating a `VanturaAgent` with standard tools.
4. Running the agent in both blocking and streaming modes.

## 🏃 How to Run

To run the example from your terminal:

```bash
# From the root of your project
dart example/example.dart
```

*Note: You will need to provide a valid API key in the `example.dart` file or modify it to use environment variables.*
